MCModRandomThings
=================

A repository for just generally playing around with MC modding.

Note that this is not affiliated with the actual MC mod named "Random Things" nor is it really intended for use in gameplay, it's just a project for me to try out random things.  (Hopefully) a decent amount of the stuff I end up making will find a home in an actual "published" mod at some point.
